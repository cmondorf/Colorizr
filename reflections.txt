How does your gem take advantage of Rubyâ€™s metaprogramming capabilities?

It uses define_method to generate the appropriate color methods.

How long did you spend working on this project?

Actual coding was several hours, but I spent a lot of time trying to understand the lesson fully.
This was the toughest lesson conceptually, by far. The idea that code writes more code is pretty straightforward, but I found the explanations for the code samples really hard to follow.

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

Getting define_method method to finally work!

Where do you still have room to grow?

I need to find more examples to work on at some point, to really cement these methods in my head.

I understand, though, that you can save time that would otherwise be spent writing repetitive code, which is a nice featuere.
